Vending Machine project

This project aims to practise on:-
    => The main programming skills
    => Dealing with files
    => Object-Oriented Programming
    => Graphical User Interface GUI

project workflow:
    1. Reading items from files "Drinks.txt", "Snacks.txt", and "Frozen.txt"
    2. Foreach type of element create indexing methodology
    3. Create a user friendly GUI that simulate real world vending machine with main function
        (insert coin, order item, and return the change)
    4. Foreach simulation the machine produce a bill
    5. Allow for the user to see and print a report of items

Basic programming skills:
    -> reading items from files
    -> read files values as item=String, amount=integer, and price=double
    -> use efficient data structure
Object Oriented skills:
    -> define data type (items)
    -> specify construction of its as a factory
    -> use gui to create it as desktop application
